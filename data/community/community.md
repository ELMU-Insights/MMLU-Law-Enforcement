# 🌐 Community-Contributed Questions

This folder is reserved for **future contributions** from the public to help expand the **MMLU-Law-Enforcement** dataset.

We welcome high-quality, multiple-choice questions (MCQs) relevant to **law enforcement**, **investigation procedures**, **criminal justice**, **cybersecurity**, and related legal frameworks in Malaysia or globally.

## 🧭 Purpose of This Folder

This `data/community/` folder will:

- Store verified public contributions that are not yet part of the official dataset.
- Act as a staging area before new questions are reviewed and potentially promoted to the `data/official/` folder.
- Serve as a space to highlight and credit community participation.
